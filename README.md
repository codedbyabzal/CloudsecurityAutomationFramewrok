🌐 Cloud Security Automation Framework
A Cloud Security Automation Framework built to proactively detect, prevent, and mitigate modern cyber threats in cloud-native applications using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Firebase, and Node.js. This solution is designed to provide end-to-end security visibility and automation from frontend to backend.

📌 Overview
This project aims to simplify and automate cloud security enforcement by integrating GCP-native security tools with a responsive React dashboard. The framework addresses OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, malicious file uploads, IAM misconfigurations, and DDoS protection — all automated for real-time protection.

🚀 Key Features
🔐 OWASP Top 10 Protection (2021 & 2017)

🛡️ DDoS Mitigation via Cloud Armor

🔍 Security Scan Trigger from React UI

📦 Malicious File Upload Scanning using Cloud Functions & VirusTotal or ClamAV

🧠 IAM Misconfiguration Detection

📊 Real-time Security Insights Dashboard

📁 Temporary Storage Bucket for scan-before-store approach

🔄 Automation-first Design using Node.js Cloud Functions
🧰 Technologies Used
Layer	Tech Stack
Frontend	React, Firebase Hosting
Backend	Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js)
Database	Firestore (NoSQL)
Cloud Platform	Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Security Tools	Cloud Armor, IAM Analyzer, Security Scanner, VPC Service Controls
Malware Detection	VirusTotal API / ClamAV
DevOps	GitHub Actions (optional CI/CD), Terraform (optional IaC)
🛡️ Security Modules Included
✅ SQL Injection Prevention (using Firestore over SQL)

✅ Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Protection

✅ DoS and Brute-force Prevention via rate limiting

✅ Cloud Armor policies on Load Balancer

✅ IAM Least Privilege Checks

✅ Auth token validation (Firebase Auth)

✅ Bot & Phishing Attack Detection

🔮 Future Enhancements
Add SIEM integration (e.g., Splunk or ELK Stack)

Support for multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure)

More robust incident response automation

Integration with Threat Intelligence APIs

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for admin dashboard
